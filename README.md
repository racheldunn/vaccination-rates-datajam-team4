# Vaccination rates and Socioeconomic Status in BC


## Project statement

The goal of this project is to discover if there is a link between vaccination rates and a health regionâ€™s socioeconomic status, and if so, whether the socioeconomic status is a driver of vaccination rates.

There are three main objectives in this project:
1. Study vaccination rates
2. Study socioeconomic factors 
3. Study the relationship between vaccination rate and low socioeconomic status

## Data Collection and Preprocessing

## Data Source: 

1. [BC Community Health Data] (http://communityhealth.phsa.ca/CHSAHealthProfiles)
2. COVID-19 Public Health dataset by health authority

## Data Wrangling:
Socioeconomic data were downloaded and formatted using the code in the following notebooks and scripts:
- notebooks/download_socioeco_scvs.ipynb
- notebooks/collate_socioeco_scvs.ipynb
- scripts/rename_socio_df_columns.py

Vaccination data were downloaded and formatted using the code in the following notebook:
- notebooks/vaccination-data-cleaning-exploration.ipynb

Merged both datasets based on the health authority code (4 digits)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. Performed EDA for fetures related with  

i. Canadian Index of Multiple Deprivation (CIMD) such as situational vulnerability, ethnocultural composition, economic dependency and residential instability <br />
ii. Ethnic identity and language <br />
iii. Household size, detached housing and state of housing <br />
iv. Education and income <br />

2. Analyzed the correlation of features with vaccination rate and identify highly correlated fetures
3. Developed and evaluated a linear regression model with these features

## Project Description

We analyzed the relationahip between vaccination rates and socioeconomic status between 5 health authories in BC. They are -

1. Vancouver Coastal Health
2. Norther Health
3. Interior Health
4. Fraser Health
5. Island Health

## Major Findings 

1. Indigenous communities were negatively correlated with vaccination rates 
2. Percenatge of detached houses negatively correlated with vaccine coverage. 
3. Percentage of Filipino population positively correlated with vaccine coverage whereas percentage of Chinese population negatively correlated with vaccine coverage.
4. The biggest predictor of vaccine coverage is percenatge of population with less than high school education level.

## Discussions

1. Assist health authorities in understanding what factors are driving vaccination rates across subregions.
2. Potentially amend policies based on targeted socioeconomic metrics that correlate with vaccination hesitancy
3. Eventually, ensure vaccine inclusion amongst population of diverse demographics
